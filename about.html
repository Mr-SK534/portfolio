    <h3>My Story <span class="about-story-icon">📖</span></h3>
    <p>
      My adventure in web development took off during lockdown when I was in class 8 , sparked by an eagerness to understand how
      digital worlds are built. Early explorations with HTML and CSS soon turned into a genuine fascination for the art
      and science behind impactful web applications. This led me to dive deeper into the full spectrum of
      development—from designing seamless user experiences with React and TypeScript to constructing robust backend
      services using Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond technical challenges, I enjoy broadening my horizons through experimenting with the latest tools,
      contributing to open-source communities, and sharing insights with peers in study groups and tech clubs. Every new
      project and collaboration brings a fresh opportunity to grow, connect, and make a difference through code.
